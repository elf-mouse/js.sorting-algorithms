## The big O notation

The complexity is usually expressed with the [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). The wikipedia page about this subject is pretty complex but you can find here a good summary of the [different complexity for the most famous data structures and sorting algorithms](http://bigocheatsheet.com/).
